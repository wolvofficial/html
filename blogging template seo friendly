<h1>Why cant I receive email verification via welendus.com?</h1>

<p>

<q>Find your passion in life and go all out!</q> 
- Carl Wolfgang Schultz</b>

</p>

<p>Getting started with a loan application can be time-consuming. I have applied for many loans in the past. I can give you some pointers on how to go about this situation. Let me see if I can help you understand why cant I receive email verification via welendus.com?</p>

<h2 id="1.">1. How to contact your lender?</h2>

<p>The best thing you can do is call over the phone. Sometimes though the lender is only doing customer service over chat or email. This can be frustrating because all you want to do is speak to someone. It appears this company is doing business online and via their mobile app. Certainly, try to call them first.</p>

<h3>Here is some contact information:</h3>

<ul>    
<li>The site has a frequently asked questions section you can view.</li>
<li>The phone number is 833-888-8238.</li>    
<li>They are open Monday through Friday 8 am to 4 pm.</li>    
<li>Email: hello@welendus.com</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2.">2. Did you submit all of the required paperwork?</h2>

<p>
Often times lenders are slow to approve an application. It helps to be as patient as possible. Believe me, they want your business. They do however need to ensure you are able to repay your loan. Their site is likely looking into your employment details. They want to verify your w2 statement.
</p>

<p>
They want to see if you can afford the loan. There are instances when additional paperwork is required to process applications. The criteria can be extensive.
</p>

<h2 id="3.">3. What other options do you have?</h2>

<p>
You are out of luck if you can&#39;t get verified via email unless you get a hold of them. It may be safe to say the site does not have a smooth email integration process.
</p>

<p>It is a known fact that lenders nowadays prefer to do business online. Customer service is rare these days. You still have options. Don't give up. I was able able to get enough lending by searching around for a bit. If they deny you at all then don&#39;t bother applying for another year.
</p>

<p>So, Why cant I receive email verification via welendus.com? Well, they pretty much either have a technical issue on their end or they are looking into your account. Either way, I would not waste too much time on the lender. Continue applying elsewhere and increase your chances of getting verified. The sooner you do the sooner you can get funded.</p>

Here is an inspirational quote that I pulled from PoetryFoundations Website:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44272/the-road-not-taken"><p><b>

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveler, long I stood And looked down one as far as I could To where it bent in the undergrowth; </b></p>

<p>Then took the other, as just as fair, And having perhaps the better claim, Because it was grassy and wanted wear; Though as for that the passing there Had worn them really about the same,</p>

<p>And both that morning equally lay In leaves, no step had trodden black. Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back.</p>I shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I&mdash; I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference.
<p>-Robert Frost</p></blockquote>
