<h3>What are some related questions you may also be asking?</h3>

<ul>
	<li>How much does an accountant cost for a small business</li>

	<p><i>The cost of an accountant for a small business can vary depending on the services required. For example, if you need someone to simply prepare your taxes, you can expect to pay less than if you need someone to provide full-fledged accounting services.<br> <br>Generally speaking, you can expect to pay anywhere from $200 to $2000 per month for an accountant, depending on the size and needs of your business. Of course, this is just a rough estimate.</i></p>

	<li>Is an accountant necessary for a small business?</li>

	<p><i>Small businesses can in fact benefit from having an accountant on their team. Accountants can give advice on some topic areas you may not have foreseen.</i></p>

	<li>What should a small business accountant do?</li>

	<p><i>The accountant should be preparing financial statements. They could gather licenses or permits. They could even write a business plan. They can develop with you a business structure.</i></p>

	<li>How do I find a small business accountant?</li>

	<p><i>If location matters to you, then you could search by location. The best way to go about it is through connections or referrals. Choose a certified accountant.</i></p>

	<li>Do I need a CPA for my LLC?</li>

	<p><i>Once your business becomes profitable, then it would be a good idea. CPAs are not appreciated enough. I have learned over the years that they are invaluable. Their credentials are hard to beat. They have a lot of knowledge.</i></p>

	<li>Do you need an accountant if you use QuickBooks?</li>

	<p><i>With the use of software nowadays it is easy to file your taxes. But, a CPA can do much more than software. A CPA can uncover things that software cannot. There is much more to a business than filing taxes. <br><br>It's a good idea to use QuickBooks, but also give that information to your accountant so they can go through it. The more prepared you are the easier it will be for your accountant.</i></p>

<h3>A Little Inspiration</h3>

<p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
	And sorry I could not travel both
	And be one traveler, long I stood
	And looked down one as far as I could
	To where it bent in the undergrowth;
</p>

<p>Then took the other, as just as fair,
	And having perhaps the better claim
	Because it was grassy and wanted wear,
	Though as for that the passing there
	Had worn them really about the same,</p>

<p>And both that morning equally lay
	In leaves no step had trodden black.
	Oh, I kept the first for another day!
	Yet knowing how way leads on to way
	I doubted if I should ever come back.
</p>
<p>I shall be telling this with a sigh somewhere ages and ages hence: <i>Two roads diverged in a wood, and I, took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference</i>.
<p>-Robert Frost</p>
