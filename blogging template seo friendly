				<p><strong>What is an alternative to Airtable?</strong></p> 
				
				<p>There are some key things to keep in mind when selecting a reputable base provider. These tidbits can help you make the best decision for your needs.</p>
				<ul>
				<li><strong>Clickup.com</strong>, <em> consider</em> what type of approval you need for your system to work.</li>
				<p>If you are self-employed, you will likely need a different type of database. Someone employed with a company may only be using Click up because they have to. If you aspire towards prosperity and enjoyment, you'll see Airtable is way easier to use.</p>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Baserow.io</strong>, <em> consider</em> what type of controls you need .</li>
					<p>An alternative to Airtable, could be a managed relational backend. This is where you can define and enter data with user access roles. The danger with self hosting is not knowing enough about the backend, but the maintenance.</p>

				<h2>How is Airtable better than Google Sheets?</h2>

				<p> Google sheets is boring compared to Airtable. The creator of Airtable is building something of an ecosystem for designers. There is no comparison.</p>

				<p>Every time I try to use Google Sheets I ask myself what is the point of doing this. It is a waist of time. I am way more
				comfortable living in the Airtable architecture.</p>

				<p>Why does this matter??</p>

				<p>Airtable allows you to create better fields to store your header information. Usually, sheets or excel make this very difficult to achieve. I have too much to do to waste time with excel or sheets. </p>

				<!-- Topical Relevance Questions from Google. No keyword Necessary. -->

				<h3>What are some related questions you may also be asking? (FAQ)</h3>

				<p>So many questions from the community. Let's explore them all..</p>

				<ul>
				<li>What to do if you see an over limits warning?</li>

				<p><i>You wil want to check for workspace limits, base limits, or table limits for overages.<br> <br>Generally speaking, it is rare to go over your limits.</i></p>

				<li>How many records does an Airtable base hold?</li>

				<p><i> 50,000 records (rows). Once your business becomes profitable, then it would be a good idea to upgrade your plan. Small businesses can in fact benefit from having a free account for their team. Databases can give insights on some topic areas you may not have foreseen.</i></p>

				<li>Is Airtable scalable?</li>

				<p><i>The site is scalable! I love Airtable. If you need more space you can upgrade your plan. You can also contact sales for a higher plan. </i></p>

				<li>How can I make my Airtable faster?</li>

				<p><i>The best way to go about it is through deleting unused records. Try filtering through your records to identify records you no longer need.</i></p>

				<li>What is the difference between a base and a workspace in Airtable?</li>

				<p><i> Bases consist of tables, views, fields, and rows. Workspaces showcase your bases.</p>
				<p> Databases are not appreciated enough. I have learned over the years that they are invaluable. Their underlying purpose is hard to beat. They give me tons of knowledge.</i></p>

				<li>Is Airtable SQL based?</li>

				<p><i>With the use of software nowadays it is easy to build a full on database. But, Airtable can do much more than standard SQL bases. It is not open source software. Airtable can uncover things that other SQL base softwares cannot. There is much more to a SaaS than repeated tasks. <br><br>It's a good idea to use Airtable, but also give that information to your database administrator so they can go through it. The more prepared you are the easier it will be for your administrator to do their job.</i></p>
			</ul>
			<p></p>
			<p><b>In short:</b> If you want an awesome database, then you will love Airtable</p>

			<h4>Wordpress Hosting </h4>
			<p>There some great web hosting options out there.</p>

			<ol>
				<li><b>Siteground</b> - Best for scaling.</li>
				<p>I have used Siteground. They are a little pricy.</p>
				<li><b>WPX.net</b> - Highly recommended.</li> <p>One click. Get your domain name. $24.99 per monoth up to 5 websites.</p>
				<li><b>Bluehost</b>- Most Popular.</li>
				<p>This has great reviews. I don't believe you can go wrong with this hosting. Be sure you are choosing what works for you.</p>

			<!--Quora Question 8k-->
			<h2>What are some interesting use cases for Airtable?</h2>

			<p>A database can lead you towards freedom. You will surpass your peers. Using a database can keep you from making bad decisions.</p>

			<p>How can you actually use this??</p>
				
			<p> Some people use them to track their food intake. I have seen others track real estate property values. I know the health care industry keeps a lot of data on customers.</p>

			<p>What's the real story??</p>

			<p>One of the challenging aspects of running a database is coming up with more ideas to track. You only have so much time in a day. It is important to pick the right area to focus your time. </p>

			<p>A great idea for a use case is to start with something that makes you money. There is no sense in tracking the many species of animals that exist. Instead, you could be tracking the most influential people on earth.</p>

			<p>As a small business owner, it's important to keep a close eye on your finances and make sure you are paying your taxes on time. A small business accountant can help you with this by keeping track of your income and expenses, as well as helping you prepare for tax season. Tax preparation services can save you a lot of time and money, so it's important to find a reputable accountant that you can trust.</p>

			<!-- Never go more than three sentences per paragraph, Gotch SEO-->

			<p>Setting up a base is easy. The hard part is migrating data around. I find putting all my bases into one base works great.</p>
			
			<p>But there's a catch..</p>
				
			<p>I put the data into many different tabs (in one table) so that they all talk to each other. This functionality is called linking.</p>

			<p>One thing I can say is building a database is so worth it. I've learned so much. The process took me from data fields to programming languages.</p>

			<p>Databases tend to take on a life of their own. Never forget to back up your data to the cloud. Yeah, it's that important.</p>

			<h3>A Little Inspiration</h3>

			<p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
				And sorry I could not travel both
				And be one traveler, long I stood
				And looked down one as far as I could
				To where it bent in the undergrowth;
			</p>

			<p>Then took the other, as just as fair,
				And having perhaps the better claim
				Because it was grassy and wanted wear,
				Though as for that the passing there
				Had worn them really about the same,</p>

			<p>And both that morning equally lay
				In leaves no step had trodden black.
				Oh, I kept the first for another day!
				Yet knowing how way leads on to way
				I doubted if I should ever come back.
			</p>
			<p>I shall be telling this with a sigh somewhere ages and ages hence: <i>Two roads diverged in a wood, and I, took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference</i>.
			<p>-Robert Frost</p>

			<p>So, how do you see if bases are getting to big on Airtable? As you can tell, Airtable is massive and it is the most valuable piece of database software I know. The base can handle most situations.</p>
