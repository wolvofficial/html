How do you decide on an account? 

<p>Tax planning can be a difficult task, especially if you are self-employed or have a complex financial situation. However, there are some key things to keep in mind that can help you make the best decision for your needs.</p>

First, consider what type of account you need. If you are self-employed, you will likely need a different type of account than someone who is employed by a company. There are also different types of accounts for different types of businesses.

<p>Second, consider your tax situation. This includes things like your tax bracket, whether you are eligible for any tax breaks, and whether you need to make estimated tax payments.</p>

Third, consider your financial goals. What are you trying to save for? How much do you need to save? When do you need access to the money?

<h2 id="1.">1. First Reason: It knows what I truly want!</h2>

<p>When it comes to figuring out what you want in life, it's important to stay true to yourself. That means being honest about your desires and setting goals that are in line with your truth. Once you know what you really want, it becomes much easier to go after it. So ask yourself: what do you truly desire? And what are your goals? Once you have the answers to these questions, you'll be well on your way to a life that's more purposeful and fulfilling.</p>

<h3>Want to know when my intution never lies?</h3>

<ul>    
<li>While I am journaling!</li>
<li>While I am listening to calm music!</li>    
<li>While I give thanks to my creator!</li>    
<li>While I am on way to accomplishing something big for myself!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2.">2. Second Reason: It comes from a higher power!</h2>

<p>There's an old saying that goes, "my intuition never lies." And while it may not always be 100% accurate, there is definitely some truth to it. Our gut feelings are often based on our past experiences and subconscious mind, which can be pretty darn accurate when it comes to making decisions.</p>

<p>That's why it's so important to listen to your intuition, especially when it comes to matters of the heart. If you're feeling doubtful or unsure about a relationship, it's probably because your gut is trying to tell you something. Trusting your instincts can be scary, but it's often the best thing you can do.</p>

<p>If you're having trouble trusting your intuition, try journaling about your feelings. Writing down your thoughts and emotions can help you to better understand them and figure out what your heart is trying to communicate.
</p>

<p>I've always been a firm believer in following my intuition. My gut has never led me astray, and I've learned to trust it implicitly. So when I started hearing about the benefits of journaling, I knew it was something I needed to try.</p>

And I'm so glad I did!

<p>Journaling has helped me to become more self-aware and in tune with my own thoughts and feelings. It's also helped me to make better decisions, both in my personal and professional life.

If you're not sure if journaling is for you, I encourage you to give it a try. You might be surprised at how helpful it can be!

<h2 id="3.">3. Third Reason: Because simple makes sense!</h2>

<p>
My intuition never lies because it is always here with me. It's part of who I am! I cannot run from it. My intuition always knows what's best for me. My intuition is my guide, my protector, and my best friend. My intuition never fails me. 
</p>

<p>There is nothing more powerful than simplicity. When we trust our intuition and follow our gut, life becomes so much easier. We don't have to second-guess our every move or worry about making a wrong decision.</p>

When we have faith in ourselves, we tap into a powerful source of guidance and wisdom. Our intuition is our built-in sense that knows what is best for us. It is a direct line to our Higher Power, and it is always there to guide and support us.

<p>When we listen to our intuition, life flows more smoothly and effortlessly. We are able to make decisions quickly and confidently. We trust ourselves more, and we feel more connected to our true purpose in life.

<h3>A Little Inspiration</h3>

<p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveler, long I stood And looked down one as far as I could to where it bent in the undergrowth;</p>

<p>Then took the other, as just as fair, And having perhaps the better claim, Because it was grassy and wanted wear; Though as for that the passing there Had worn them really about the same,</p>

<p>And both that morning equally lay In leaves, no step had trodden black. Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back.</p>I shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference.
