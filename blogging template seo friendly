I have always thought that <b>my intuition never lies</b> to me. My friends and family would often ask me for advice on different matters, both big and small, and I would always give them my honest answer based on what I felt was right. My gut has always served me well and I have never regretted following its lead.

In fact, more often than not, my intuition has led me to make some of the best decisions of my life. Now, I'm not saying that my intuition is always right, but it has never led me astray. Only when I deny my obsessions.

So, if you're ever feeling lost or unsure of what to do, listen to your intuition! It might just be the best decision you ever make.

<h2 id="1.">1. First Reason: It knows what I truly want!</h2>

<p>When it comes to figuring out what you want in life, it's important to stay true to yourself. That means being honest about your desires and setting goals that are in line with your truth. Once you know what you really want, it becomes much easier to go after it. So ask yourself: what do you truly desire? And what are your goals? Once you have the answers to these questions, you'll be well on your way to a life that's more purposeful and fulfilling.</p>

<h3>Want to know when my intution never lies?</h3>

<ul>    
<li>While I am journaling!</li>
<li>While I am listening to calm music!</li>    
<li>While I give thanks to my creator!</li>    
<li>While I am on way to accomplishing something big for myself!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2.">2. Second Reason: It comes from a higher power!</h2>

<p>
There's an old saying that goes, "my intuition never lies." And while it may not always be 100% accurate, there is definitely some truth to it. Our gut feelings are often based on our past experiences and subconscious mind, which can be pretty darn accurate when it comes to making decisions.

That's why it's so important to listen to your intuition, especially when it comes to matters of the heart. If you're feeling doubtful or unsure about a relationship, it's probably because your gut is trying to tell you something. Trusting your instincts can be scary, but it's often the best thing you can do.

If you're having trouble trusting your intuition, try journaling about your feelings. Writing down your thoughts and emotions can help you to better understand them and figure out what your heart is trying to communicate.
</p>

<p>
I've always been a firm believer in following my intuition. My gut has never led me astray, and I've learned to trust it implicitly. So when I started hearing about the benefits of journaling, I knew it was something I needed to try.

And I'm so glad I did!

Journaling has helped me to become more self-aware and in tune with my own thoughts and feelings. It's also helped me to make better decisions, both in my personal and professional life.

If you're not sure if journaling is for you, I encourage you to give it a try. You might be surprised at how helpful it can be!

<h2 id="3.">3. Third Reason: Because simple makes sense!</h2>

<p>
My intuition never lies because it is always here with me. It's part of who I am! I cannot run from it. My intuition always knows what's best for me. My intuition is my guide, my protector, and my best friend. My intuition never fails me. 
</p>

<p>
There is nothing more powerful than simplicity. When we trust our intuition and follow our gut, life becomes so much easier. We don't have to second-guess our every move or worry about making a wrong decision.

When we have faith in ourselves, we tap into a powerful source of guidance and wisdom. Our intuition is our built-in sense that knows what is best for us. It is a direct line to our Higher Power, and it is always there to guide and support us.

When we listen to our intuition, life flows more smoothly and effortlessly. We are able to make decisions quickly and confidently. We trust ourselves more, and we feel more connected to our true purpose in life.

<b><h3>In Conclusion to "My Intuition Never Lies"</h3></b>

<p>
We've all been there before. We're at a crossroads in life and we don't know which way to go. We might be considering a new job, or whether or not to move to a new city. We might be wondering if we should stay in our current relationship or end it. These are all tough decisions to make, and often times we don't have anyone to turn to for advice.

That's when it's time to listen to your intuition.

Your intuition is that little voice inside your head that speaks to you when you're faced with a tough decision. It's that feeling you get in your gut when you just know something is right or wrong.

You might not always be able to explain why you feel the way you do, but trust me, your intuition never lies.

So, I want to challenge you today! What areas do you need to rethink? How can you start listening to that little voice inside of you? You may discover it's been there all this time. Maybe it's been waiting for you to listen. 

Thank you!

<h3>Here is an inspirational quote that I pulled from PoetryFoundations Website:</h3>

<blockquote cite="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44272/the-road-not-taken"><p><b>

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveler, long I stood And looked down one as far as I could to where it bent in the undergrowth; </b></p>

<p>Then took the other, as just as fair, And having perhaps the better claim, Because it was grassy and wanted wear; Though as for that the passing there Had worn them really about the same,</p>

<p>And both that morning equally lay In leaves, no step had trodden black. Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back.</p>I shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference.
<p>-Robert Frost</p>
